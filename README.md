# GitHub Actions on a Self-Hosted Runner

- With self-hosted runners, we can set up and manage the runner infrastructure ourselves.

- Self-hosted runners can be deployed on virtual machines, physical machines, or in cloud providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.

- They provide more flexibility regarding available resources, dependencies, and network access.

- We can use self-hosted runners for repositories hosted on GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise Server.

- They are beneficial when we need to run workflows that require specialized hardware, software configurations, or access to on-premises resources.
